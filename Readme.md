### AI Product Engineer | Full-Stack Architect | Building Production-Ready AI Systems

I build scalable web products with AI at the core.  
From LLM integrations and AI agents to full-stack SaaS platforms — I focus on clean architecture, fast execution, and real business impact.

Currently building and shipping AI-powered systems used in real production environments.

## 🚀 What I Do

- Design and ship AI-powered applications (LLMs, agents, RAG systems)
- Architect scalable backend systems (.NET / Node / Python)
- Build modern, performant frontends (React, Tailwind)
- Deploy production-ready systems with Docker & CI/CD
- Optimize for performance, cost, and maintainability

I care about systems that scale — technically and business-wise.
